# Micro Controller-based Smart RailwayÂ system
This project addressed railway challenges using the 8051 microcontroller to enhance safety, automate processes, and improve efficiency. Modules for signal synchronization, automated doors, real-time timer displays, and location tracking were developed using Keil and Proteus, streamlining operations effectively.
